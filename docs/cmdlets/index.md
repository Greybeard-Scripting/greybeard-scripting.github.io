# cmdlets Overview

This section provides an overview of custom cmdlets that are not included out-of-the-box (OOB) with PowerShell Universal. These cmdlets are either developed in-house or sourced from the community to extend the platform's capabilities beyond the default set.

## What are Non-OOB cmdlets?

Non-OOB cmdlets are modules, controls, or integrations that do not ship with PowerShell Universal by default. They may include:

- Custom UI controls
- Specialized integrations
- Community-contributed modules
- Organization-specific enhancements

## Why Use Custom cmdlets?

Custom cmdlets allow you to tailor your environment to specific needs, fill gaps in OOB functionality, and leverage community innovation. They can help you:

- Address unique business requirements
- Integrate with third-party systems
- Enhance user experience
- Accelerate development with reusable solutions

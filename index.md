# Welcome to the PowerShell Universal Documentation

This documentation site is designed to help you get the most out of PowerShell Universal by providing:

- **Comprehensive guides** for using and extending PowerShell Universal
- **Coding standards** to ensure high-quality, maintainable scripts and modules
- **Documentation for non-OOB (Out-of-the-Box) cmdlets and components** that enhance your automation solutions
- **Best practices** for PowerShell development

## Purpose

Our goal is to provide a single source of truth for:

- Team and community coding standards
- Usage and examples of custom cmdlets and components not included with PowerShell Universal by default
- Guidance on writing clean, efficient, and secure PowerShell code

## Coding Standards

We promote consistent, readable, and maintainable code. Key standards include:

- Use clear and descriptive names for functions, variables, and parameters
- Follow PowerShell best practices for error handling and input validation
- Write reusable, modular functions and scripts
- Include comments and documentation for all public functions and modules
- Adhere to formatting and style guidelines (see the Coding Standards section for details)

## Non-OOB Cmdlets and Components

This site documents custom cmdlets, modules, and UI components that are not delivered with PowerShell Universal out-of-the-box. These additions help you:

- Extend the platform's capabilities
- Integrate with external systems
- Address unique business requirements

Refer to the [Components](docs/components) section for details on available custom components.

## General PowerShell Best Practices

- Use approved verbs for function names
- Avoid using aliases in scripts and modules
- Prefer pipeline-friendly functions
- Implement robust error handling with `try/catch/finally`
- Write Pester tests for your code

For more details, see the Coding Standards and Best Practices sections in this documentation.
